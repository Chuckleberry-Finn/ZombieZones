description=[h1][b]This mod does nothing.[/b][/h1]
description=[b]It does nothing without the appropriate supplemental file.[/b]
description=[h2]With the file: the mod allows for  'Modifiable zones for zombie behavior.'[/h2]
description=[h3]Commissioned by [b]Zac[/b] and [b]RebornSn[/b] of [url=https://discord.gg/deadworldrp]DeadWorld RP[/url][/h3]

description=[h2]This mod is slated to be fully released on 1/1/24.[/h2]
description=[h3][i][b]Why release it this way? Why make it exclusive temporarily?[/b][/i][/h3]
description=[h3]This is a compromise; all parties involved agree mods should [i]not[/i] be exclusive. However, as the mod was commissioned it is only fair that the party paying for its creation get to enjoy some exclusivity, at least temporarily.[/h3]
description=[i]Note: The current workshop content is still required for the mod to work if the server is using it.[/i]
